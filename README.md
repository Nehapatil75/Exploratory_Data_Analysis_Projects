# Exploratory_Data_Analysis_Projects
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a form of analysis to understand the insights of the key characteristics of various entities of a given dataset like column(s), row(s), etc. 
It is done by applying Pandas, NumPy, statistical methods, and data visualization packages.
Most EDA techniques are graphical in nature with a few quantitative techniques. The reason for the heavy reliance on graphics is that by its very nature the main role of EDA is to open-mindedly explore, and graphics gives the analysts unparalleled power to do so, enticing the data to reveal its structural secrets, and being always ready to gain some new, often unsuspected, insight into the data. 
In combination with the natural pattern-recognition capabilities that we all possess, graphics provides, of course, unparalleled power to carry this out.
